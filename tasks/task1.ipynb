    "## Task 1: Regex Pattern for Integer Hours\n",
    "For Task 1, you want to create a regex pattern that can match to all integer hours within the recipe text--whether it is in the form of a single integer hour (ex: \"2 HOURS\") or a range of integer hours (ex: \"4-5 hours\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "Things to Note: \n",
    "1. Create a variable called `integer_hour_pattern` and use the `re.compile()` method to store your regex pattern. Ensure sure that the regex pattern is written as a raw string by prefixing it with `r`.\n",
    "    - Make this that regular expression is __*case-insensitive*__--where the regex pattern matches to non-capitalized or capitalized words such as \"hours\" or \"HOURS\".\n",
    "    - Additionally, make sure the regular expression pattern should __*only extract to integer hours*__ and should not match '5 hours' if is part of a range like '4.5-5.5 hours'.\n",
    "4. Create a variable called `matches`. Within this variable use the correct regex method to find all the matches.\n",
    "5. Create a for-loop that goes through every `item` in `matches`. Then, the `item` is printed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this, your regex pattern should output EXACTLY to the phrases below (where there should not be any more or any less ouputs):\n",
    "* \"2 HOURS\"\n",
    "* \"4-5 hours\""
