    "## Task 1: Regex Pattern for Integer Hours\n",
    "Create a function, `task1()`, that will simply return a regex pattern matching all integer numbers of hours within the recipe text, whether a single integer hour (e.g., \"2 HOURS\") or a range of integer hours (e.g., \"4-5 hours\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to Note: \n",
    "1. Ensure that the regex pattern is written as a raw string by prefixing it with `r`.\n",
    "2. Make sure the regular expression is __*case-insensitive*__: The regex pattern should match either captialized or non-capitalized words such as \"HOURS\" or \"hours\".\n",
    "3. Make sure the regular expression pattern __*matches only integer hours*__. For instance, it should not match '5 hours' if is part of a range like \"4.5-5.5 hours\".\n",
    "4. Use the `re.compile()` method to store your regex pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below your `task1()` definition is a notebook cell where you will code the value for the variable `matches` and test your code."
