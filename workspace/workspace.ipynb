    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "For this assignment, the main learning objectives would be:\n",
    "1. __Get Comfortable with Regular Expressions:__ Learn how to create and apply regular expression patterns to find, match, split, and replace text in documents.\n",
    "2. __Master Text Processing Techniques:__ Practice using `re.findall()`, `re.sub()`, and `re.split()` to effectively extract, modify, and organize text.\n",
    "3. __Apply Your Skills:__ Use your knowledge in regular expressions to solve real-world problems--in this case, organizing and managing structured data like recipes!"

Daphne, a mother of one daughter named Lucy, who is happily married to her husband, Cole--are planning to have a Sunday family cooking session and she wants to be fully prepared for it! Because Daphne is on a time crunch to make the dishes, you will be using regular expressions to effectively extracting, modifying, and organizing in the recipe text!\n",

This is useful when you want to apply quantifiers to part of a pattern but don't need to capture the matched text for later. <br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'\\d+(?:-\\d+)*')__--which is a non-capturing group that matches a hyphen followed by one or more digits, zero or one more times. </br>  |\n",
