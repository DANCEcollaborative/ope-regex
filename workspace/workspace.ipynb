    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "For this assignment, the main learning objectives are\n",
    "1. __Get Comfortable with Regular Expressions:__ Learn how to create and apply regular expression patterns to find, match, split, and replace text in documents.\n",
    "2. __Master Text Processing Techniques:__ Practice using `re.findall()`, `re.split()`, and `re.sub()` to effectively extract, modify, and organize text.\n",
    "3. __Apply Your Skills:__ Use your knowledge in regular expressions to solve real-world problems -- in this case, organizing and managing structured data like recipes!"

    "# Cooking Activity\n",
    "### Reduce Cooking Time for Time Efficiency!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will apply regular expressions for a cooking activity. Daphne is planning to have a Sunday family cooking session with her daughter, Lucy, and her husband, Cole. She wants to be fully prepared for it. Because Daphne is in a time crunch to make the dishes, you will help by using regular expressions to effectively extract, modify, and organize the recipe text!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:** \n",
    "* Regular Expressions will also be called \"RE\", \"RegEx\", or \"regex\" in this activity. \n",
    "* **Make sure to execute (run) every code cell. Many code cells are prerequisites to others, so you'll generally want to run them in order from top to bottom.**\n",
    "* This activity includes eight tasks. As you finish one, the next one will be made available to you. *Depending on your browser, you may need to scroll down to see each new task.*\n",
    "* You don't need to add any new cells, although it okay if you do.\n",
    "* In the definitions below, `recipe_text` is a variable referring to the text upon which the regex pattern will be applied.\n",
    "* For all the regular expressions you define in the assignment, make sure to define them using [raw string notation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#raw-string-notation). This will make it easier for you to understand and debug your expressions, as discussed in the readings.\n",
    "* **To complete this activity, the only requirement is entering regular expressions and executing notebook cells. If you find yourself doing any coding other than creating Python `assert()` statements to test your regular expressions, you're doing it wrong.**"

    "| RegEx Functions | Meaning |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| `re.compile()` | Compiles a regular expression into a pattern object which can then use other `re` functions.Example: <br>__regex_pattern = re.compile('cat')__ <br>__re.search(regex_pattern,\"the cat in the hat\")__</br>|\n",
    "| `re.search()` |  Scans through a string, looking for any location where the regular expression pattern matches, and returns a match object for the first occurrence. <br> Example: __search_method = re.search(regex_pattern, recipe_text)__ </br> |\n",
    "| `re.match()` |Checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, and returns a match object if the regular expression matches at the start. <br> Example: __match_method = re.match(regex_pattern, recipe_text)__ </br>|\n",
    "| `re.finditer()` | Finds all substrings where regular expression matches, and returns an iterator, so you can loop over the matches. <br> Example: __finditer_method = re.match(regex_pattern, recipe_text)__</br>|\n",
    "| `re.split()` | Returns a list where the string has been split at each match. <br> Example: __split_method = re.split = (regex_pattern, recipe_text)__</br>|\n",
    "| `re.sub()` | Replaces one or more matches with a string. <br> Example: __sub_method = re.sub(regex_pattern,replacement, recipe_text)__. In this case, replacement is the phrase that will replace the pattern within `recipe_text`. </br> |\n",
    "| `re.findall()` | Returns a list of matches for the regular expression. If there are no groups, findall returns a list of strings matching the entire pattern.<br>If there is exactly one *capturing* group, findall returns the group.<br>If there is more than one group, findall returns a tuple of strings matching the *capturing* groups -- matches for *non-capturing* groups will not appear in the output.<br>If the pattern contains only one *non-capturing* group, findall will return the entire pattern, as it does when there are no groups. <br> Example __findall_method = regex_pattern.findall(recipe_text)\"__ </br>|\n",

    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| `*` | Matches zero, one or more of the previous expression. <br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'[0-9]*')__--which matches phrase(s) that contains digits from 0 to 9. </br>|\n",
    "| `?` | Matches zero or one of the previous expression. <br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'colou?r')__--which matches the string \"color\" or \"colour\" because 'u' is optional. </br> |\n",
    "| `+` | Matches one or more of the previous expression. <br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'\\d+')__--which matches one or more digits. </br> |\n",
    "| `\\` | Used to escape a special character (i.e., *metacharacter*) to treat the character as regular text. <br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'\\\\.')__--which matches a literal period dot '.' </br>|\n",
    "| `.` | Matches any character. </br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'a.b')__--which matches any string where 'a' is followed by a single character and then 'b'. </br> |\n",
    "| `()` | Creates capture groups to extract and refer to specific parts of a matched string. <br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'(\\d{3}')__--which matches any text with 3 consecutive digits. </br> |\n",
    "| `(?:)` | Non-capturing group that groups parts of a pattern together but does not create a capturing group that you can refer to later.  <br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'\\d+(?:-\\d+)*')__--which is a non-capturing group that matches a hyphen followed by one or more digits, zero or one more times. </br> |\n",
    "| `\\|` | Serves as an \"or\" statement that will match the pattern either on the right or left of the bar.  <br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'apple\\|orange')__ --which matches either \"apple\" or \"orange\". </br>  |\n",
    "| `[]` | Matches a range of characters. <br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'[0-9]')__--which matches any single digit. </br>  |\n",
    "| `{}` | Matches a specific number of occurrences <br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'a{3}')__--which matches exactly three consecutive 'a' characters. |\n",
    "| `^` | Matches the start of a string. <br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'^Hello')__--which matches 'Hello' only if it appears at the start of the string. |\n",
    "| `$` | Matches the end of a string. <br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'world!$')__--which matches 'world!' only if it appears at the end of the string.|\n",
    "| `\\d` | Matches a digit [0-9]. <br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'\\d')__--which matches any single digit. |\n",
    "| `\\D` | Matches a non-digit <br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'\\D')__--which matches any character that is not a digit [0-9] |\n",
    "| `\\w` | Matches an alphanumeric character (letters [a-zA-Z]) and digits [0-9, and underscores.]<br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'\\w')--which matches all alphanumeric characters and underscores in the text, ignoring spaces and puncutation. |\n",
    "| `\\W` | Matches an non-alphanumeric character <br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'\\W')__--which matches punctuation and spaces in the text.  |\n",
    "| `\\s` | Matches a whitespace character. <br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'\\s')--which matches any whitespace character in the text. |\n",
    "| `\\S` | Matches a non-whitespace character <br> Example: __regex_pattern = re.compile(r'\\S')__--which matches any non-whitespace character in the text (including letters, punctuation, and digits). |"
