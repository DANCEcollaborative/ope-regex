This OPE will provide you with practice opportunities on NumPy vectorization. To prepare for the activity, make sure you have thoroughly read and understood the NumPy Primer, as well as Linear Algebra with NumPy primer. The experience will benefit you in your Project 2.

Similar to the practice OPE, here you will have 80 minutes to work through four tasks in the Cloud9 environment. Note that all of the tasks were designed to have at least two distinct solution paths; you are encouraged to explore these different paths, discuss with your teammate, and evaluate your implementation on the test data.

Please remember to complete the **pre-quiz** (credit received on completion) below using the token that was provided in your email prior to starting the OPE task. This will unlock the instructions for the actual OPE task. Then use the token provided by the OPE task submitter on Cloud9 to unlock the post-quiz. Be sure to fill out the graded post-quiz (graded on correctness) after you are done with the OPE task on Cloud9.

**You will receive your token for the pre-quiz about 20 minutes prior to the OPE task**.
